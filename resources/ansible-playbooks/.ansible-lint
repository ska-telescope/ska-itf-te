# .ansible-lint

profile: production # min, basic, moderate,safety, shared, production

# Ansible-lint is able to recognize and load skip rules stored inside
# `.ansible-lint-ignore` (or `.config/ansible-lint-ignore.txt`) files.
# To skip a rule just enter filename and tag, like "playbook.yml package-latest"
# on a new line.
# Optionally you can add comments after the tag, prefixed by "#". We discourage
# the use of skip_list below because that will hide violations from the output.
# When putting ignores inside the ignore file, they are marked as ignored, but
# still visible, making it easier to address later.
skip_list:
  # Disable these linting rules because they makes the variables and tasks quite awkward to work with.
  # For example, a `users` variable in the var_setup role would have to be called var_setup_users.
  - var-naming[no-role-prefix]
  - name[prefix]

# Ansible-lint does not automatically load rules that have the 'opt-in' tag.
# You must enable opt-in rules by listing each rule 'id' below.
enable_list:
  - args
  - empty-string-compare # opt-in
  - no-log-password # opt-in
  - no-same-owner # opt-in
  # add yaml here if you want to avoid ignoring yaml checks when yamllint
  # library is missing. Normally its absence just skips using that rule.
  - yaml
